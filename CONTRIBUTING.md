Thank you for your interest in contributing to GodSVG!

## PR workflow

For code contributions, use the following workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b implement-gradients`
3. Make your modifications, add them with `git add .`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Implement linear gradients"`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin implement-gradients`
6. Create a new pull request with a clear and informative title and describe your changes.

This is the preferred workflow, but tidiness is not as important as work being done, so feel free to do something else you're comfortable with.

After submitting your pull request, I (MewPurPur) will review your changes and may provide feedback or request modifications. Be responsive to any comments or suggestions. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged. Afterward, you can delete your branch from your fork.

## Development guidelines

Follow the [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

Do understand that PRs with a large maintenance cost may be under high scrutiny because of their long-term responsibility, even in the absence of the original contributor.
