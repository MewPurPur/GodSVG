**GodSVG is an application for creating optimized Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.** It is mainly designed for programmers, allowing them to easily edit individual SVG elements and view the corresponding code in real-time.
GodSVG is inspired by the need for an SVG editor without abstractions that produces optimized SVG files.

## Features

- **Interactive SVG editing:** Modify individual elements of an SVG file using a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time code:** As you manipulate elements in the UI, code is instantly generated and can be edited.
- **Optimized SVG output:** Generate clean and efficient SVG files.
- **Accessible on mobile:** GodSVG aims to be usable on mobile devices.

## How to get it

Simply check out [the list of GodSVG releases](https://github.com/MewPurPur/GodSVG/releases) and download the version you want.

Note that if you're on MacOS, you need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) if you haven't yet. I don't have the time or money to deal with Apple's gatekeeping.
