**GodSVG is an application for creating optimized Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.** It is mainly designed for programmers, allowing them to easily edit individual SVG elements and view the corresponding code in real-time.
GodSVG is inspired by the need for a SVG editor without abstractions that produces optimized SVG files.

## Features

- **Interactive SVG editing:** Modify individual elements of a SVG file using a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-time code:** As you manipulate elements in the UI, code is instantly generated and can be edited.
- **Optimized SVG output:** Generate clean and efficient SVG files. _(Planned: Ways to minify the output)_
- **Accessible on mobile:** GodSVG aims to be usable on mobile devices.
